        "This recipe makes the best naan I have tasted outside of an Indian restaurant. I can't make enough of it for my family. I serve it with shish kabobs, but I think they would eat it plain."

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
        <li>4 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups bread flower</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic (optional)</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy. Stir in sugar, milk, egg, salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead for 6 to 8 minutes on a lightly floured surface, or until smooth. Place dough in a well oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and set aside to rise. Let it rise 1 hour, until the dough has doubled in volume.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball. Roll into balls, and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>During the second rising, preheat grill to high heat. </li>
        <li>At grill side, roll one ball of dough out into a thin circle. Lightly oil grill. Place dough on grill, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until puffy and lightly browned. Brush uncooked side with butter, and turn over. Brush cooked side with butter, and cook until browned, another 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from grill, and continue the process until all the naan has been prepared.</li></ol>
    <p><em>Tip :</em> Aluminum foil can be used to keep food moist, cook it evenly, and make clean-up easier.</p>
