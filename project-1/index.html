            When Science is in the Country

        <p>
            When science is in the country a cow meows and the moon jumps from limb to
            limb through the trees like a silver ape.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cow bow-wows to hear all voice of itself. The grass sinks back into the earth
            looking for its mother.
        </p>
        <p>
            A farmer dreamed he harvested the universe, and had a barn full of stars, and a
            herd of clouds fenced in the pasture.
        </p>
        <p>
            The farmer awoke to something screaming in the kitchen, which he identified as
            the farmerette.
        </p>
        <p>
            'Oh my my,' cried the farmer, 'what is to become of what became?'<br>
            'It's a good piece of bread and a bad farmer man,' she cried.<br>
            'Oh the devil take the monotony of the field,' he screamed.<br>
            'Which grows your eating thing,' she wailed.<br>
            'Which is the hell with me too,' he screamed.<br>
            'And the farmerette?' she screamed.<br>
            'And the farmerette,' he howled.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            A scientist looked through his magnifying glass in the neighborhood.
